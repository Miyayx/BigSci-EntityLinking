Supervised Learning,Hit,Supervised learning,,,Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from supervised (labeled) training data. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which is called a classifier (if the output is discrete, see classification) or a regression function (if the output is continuous, see regression). The inferred function should predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1108953

In this context, a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer (which basically means that the problem can be stated by a set of mathematical instructions). Informally, a computational problem consists of problem instances and solutions to these problem instances. For example, primality testing is the problem of determining whether a given number is prime or not. The instances of this problem are natural numbers, and the solution to an instance is yes or no based on whether the number is prime or not.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1056887

Higher-level features and concepts are thus defined in terms of lower-level ones, and such a hierarchy of features is called a deep architecture; see for a review of the field. Most of these models are based on unsupervised learning of representations, and this makes them particularly useful to extract generic abstractions and features from a large corpus of examples, even when these examples are not necessarily labeled, as in semi-supervised learning, and not necessarily of the immediate tasks of interest, as in multi-task learning.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6823788

In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating what happens when a collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics).

Machine Learning,Hit,Machine learning,,,Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a scientific discipline concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases. A learner can take advantage of examples (data) to capture characteristics of interest of their unknown underlying probability distribution. Data can be seen as examples that illustrate relations between observed variables. A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data; the difficulty lies in the fact that the set of all possible behaviors given all possible inputs is too large to be covered by the set of observed examples (training data). Hence the learner must generalize from the given examples, so as to be able to produce a useful output in new cases.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1074721

Parallel Computing,Hit,Parallel computing,,,Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multicore processors.

Modal Logic,Hit,Modal logic,,,Modal logic is a type of formal logic primarily developed in the 1960s that extends classical propositional and predicate logic to include operators expressing modality. Modals words that express modalities qualify a statement. For example, the statement "John is happy" might be qualified by saying that John is usually happy, in which case the term "usually" is functioning as a modal. The traditional alethic modalities, or modalities of truth, include possibility ("Possibly, p", "It is possible that p"), necessity ("Necessarily, p", "It is necessary that p"), and impossibility ("It is impossible that p"). Other modalities that have been formalized in modal logic include temporal modalities, or modalities of time (notably, "It was the case that p", "It has always been that p", "It will be that p", "It will always be that p"), deontic modalities (notably, "It is obligatory that p", and "It is permissible that p"), epistemic modalities, or modalities of knowledge ("It is known that p") and doxastic modalities, or modalities of belief ("It is believed that p").,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1054648

While the topic is most often associated with its use in video games and other physical simulations, it also has applications in robotics. In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating what happens when a collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics). Solving collision detection problems requires extensive use of concepts from linear algebra and computational geometry.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1103448

Bayesian updating is an important technique throughout statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics: Exhibiting a Bayesian derivation for a statistical method automatically ensures that the method works as well as any competing method, for some cases. Bayesian updating is especially important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a range of fields including science, engineering, medicine, and law.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2464398
Parallel Computers,Hit,Parallel computing,,,Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multicore processors. Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006). http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf "The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley" (PDF).

This view was further developed by John McCarthy's 1958 advice-taker proposal to use forward chaining under the control of logical propositions. The Planner programming language 1969, 1971 used both forward chaining (invoked by assertions) and backward chaining (invoked by goals).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1001393

In this report they discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting "active learning." While there has been much enthusiasm for active learning, a variety of research studies since the 1990s, has since promoted an important principle: Guidance early, and then practice later is suggested for the best results.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/3946513

More simply put, concepts are the mental categories that help us classify objects, events, or ideas and each object, event, or idea has a set of common relevant features. Thus, concept learning is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups or categories that contain concept-relevant features with groups or categories that do not contain concept-relevant features.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6653768

Data Mining,Hit,Data mining,,,Data mining (the analysis step of the "Knowledge Discovery in Databases" process, or KDD), a relatively young and interdisciplinary field of computer science, is the process that attempts to discover patterns in large data sets. It utilizes methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data management aspects, data preprocessing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1022540

Grid Computing,Hit,Grid computing,,,Grid computing is the federation of computer resources from multiple administrative domains to reach a common goal. The grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads that involve a large number of files. What distinguishes grid computing from conventional high performance computing systems such as cluster computing is that grids tend to be more loosely coupled, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application, commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes. Grids are often constructed with general-purpose grid middleware software libraries.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1052680
