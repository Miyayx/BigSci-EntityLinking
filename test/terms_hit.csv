semi-supervised learning,Hit,Semi-supervised learning,en#Machine learning###ch#机器学习,,Semi-supervised learning is a class of machine learning techniques that make use of both labeled and unlabeled data for training - typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data. when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data. can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy. The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g. to transcribe an audio segment) or a physical experiment (e.g. determining the 3D structure of a protein or determining whether there is oil at a particular location). The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render a fully labeled training set infeasible. whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations. semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. Semi-supervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2465741

Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing. along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others. and subsequent insertion into a database). deriving patterns within the structured data. and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance. novelty. and interestingness.

The main difference of DNA to SNA is that DNA take the domain of time into account.

principal components analysis,Hit,Principal component analysis,en#Applied sciences#Evidence-based medicine###ch#统计学术语#应用科学#循证医学,en#Science#Terminology###ch#科学#术语,Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is. accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible). and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it be orthogonal to (i.e.. uncorrelated with) the preceding components. Principal components are guaranteed to be independent only if the data set is jointly normally distributed. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. Depending on the field of application. it is also named the discrete Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT). the Hotelling transform or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1002011

Data can be seen as examples that illustrate relations between observed variables.

The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning. each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function. which is called a classifier (if the output is discrete. see classification) or a regression function (if the output is continuous. see regression). The inferred function should predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1108953

Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing. along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others. and subsequent insertion into a database). deriving patterns within the structured data. and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance. novelty. and interestingness. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization. text clustering. concept/entity extraction. production of granular taxonomies. sentiment analysis. document summarization. and entity relation modeling (i.e.. learning relations between named entities).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/3532564

The goal of oncogenomics is to identify new oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis. predicting clinical outcome of cancers. and new targets for cancer therapies.

This sequence can be used to approximate the joint distribution (e.g.. to generate a histogram of the distribution); to approximate the marginal distribution of one of the variables. or some subset of the variables (for example. the unknown parameters or latent variables); or to compute an integral (such as the expected value of one of the variables).

According to behaviorism. individuals' response to different environmental stimuli shapes our behaviors. Behaviorists believe behavior can be studied in a methodical and recognizable manner with no consideration of internal mental states. Thus. all behavior can be clarified without the need to reflect on psychological mental states. The behaviorist school of thought maintains that behaviors as such can be described scientifically without recourse either to internal physiological events or to hypothetical constructs such as the mind. Behaviorism comprises the position that all theories should have observational correlates but that there are no philosophical differences between publicly observable processes (such as actions) and privately observable processes (such as thinking and feeling).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1049758

The incorrect application of automation. which occurs most often. is an effort to eliminate or replace human labor. Simply put. whereas correct application of automation can net as much as 3 to 4 times original output with no increase in current human labor costs. Incorrect application of automation can only save a fraction of current labor level costs. In the scope of industrialisation. automation is a step beyond mechanisation. Whereas mechanisation provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work.

It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. The term "selection bias" most often refers to the distortion of a statistical analysis. resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account then certain conclusions drawn may be wrong.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/5595198

systems biology,Hit,Systems biology,en#Biophysics#Natural sciences#Biology#Bioinformatics#Systems biology###ch#生物物理学#自然科学#生物学#生物信息学#系统生物学,en#Science###ch#技术#科学,Systems biology is a term used to describe an emerging approach applied to biomedical and biological scientific research. Systems biology is a biology-based inter-disciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems. using a more holistic perspective (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) approach to biological and biomedical research. Particularly from year 2000 onwards. the term systems biology has been used widely in the biosciences in a variety of contexts. One of the outreaching aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties. properties of cells. tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques which fall under the remit of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1029839

The field draws on theories and methods including graph theory from mathematics. statistical mechanics from physics. data mining and information visualization from computer science. inferential modeling from statistics. and social structure from sociology. The National Research Council defines network science as "the study of network representations of physical. biological. and social phenomena leading to predictive models of these phenomena.",http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6064937
