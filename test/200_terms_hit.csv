It utilizes methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence. machine learning. statistics. and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step. it involves database and data management aspects. data preprocessing. model and inference considerations. interestingness metrics. complexity considerations. post-processing of discovered structures. visualization. and online updating.;;;数据挖掘(Data Mining)是通过分析每个数据，从大量数据中寻找其规律的技术，主要有数据准备、规律寻找和规律表示3个步骤。数据挖掘的任务有关联分析、聚类分析、分类分析、异常分析、特异群组分析和演变分析等。,

semi-supervised learning,Hit,Semi-supervised learning;;;半监督学习,en#Machine learning###ch#机器学习,,Semi-supervised learning is a class of machine learning techniques that make use of both labeled and unlabeled data for training - typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data. when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data. can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy. The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g. to transcribe an audio segment) or a physical experiment (e.g. determining the 3D structure of a protein or determining whether there is oil at a particular location). The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render a fully labeled training set infeasible. whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations. semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. Semi-supervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning.;;;,

text categorization,Hit,Document classification;;;,en#Machine learning#Data mining#Natural language processing#Knowledge representation#Information science###ch#机器学习#数据挖掘#自然语言处理#知识表示#资讯科学,,Document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science. information science and computer science. The task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories. This may be done "manually" (or "intellectually") or algorithmically. The intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science. while the algorithmic classification of documents is used mainly in information science and computer science. The problems are overlapping. however. and there is therefore also interdisciplinary research on document classification.;;;,

Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Through quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form. a researcher can answer empirical questions. which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings. particularly in the social sciences and in education.;;;,

The information to be encoded can be text or numeric data. Usual data size is from a few bytes up to 1556 bytes. The length of the encoded data depends on the number of cells in the matrix. Error correction codes are often used to increase reliability: even if one or more cells is damaged so it is unreadable. the message can still be read. A Data Matrix symbol can store up to 2.335 alphanumeric characters.;;;,
