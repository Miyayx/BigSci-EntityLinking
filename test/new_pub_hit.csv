It derives its name from the idea that DNA can be used to supplement or alter genes within an individual's cells as a therapy to treat disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional. therapeutic gene in order to replace a mutated gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a mutation. or using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a natural human gene) to provide treatment. In gene therapy. DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a "vector". which is used to get the DNA inside cells within the body. Once inside. the DNA becomes expressed by the cell machinery. resulting in the production of therapeutic protein. which in turn treats the patient's disease.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1045408

Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10 −12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence. known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-. silver-. or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1183938

Getting to grips with phage display,Hit,Phage display,Protein-protein interaction assays#Bacteriophages#Molecular biology#Microbiology,,Phage display is a laboratory technique for the study of protein–protein. protein–peptide. and protein–DNA interactions that uses bacteriophages to connect proteins with the genetic information that encodes them. Phage display was first described by George P. Smith in 1985. when he demonstrated the display of peptides on filamentous phage by fusing the peptide of interest on to gene III of filamentous phage. A patent by George Pieczenik claiming priority from 1985 also describes the generation of phage display libraries. This technology was further developed and improved by groups at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology with Winter and McCafferty and The Scripps Research Institute with Lerner and Barbas for display of proteins such as antibodies for therapeutic protein engineering. The connection between genotype and phenotype enables large libraries of proteins to be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection. which is analogous to natural selection. The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are M13 and fd filamentous phage. though T4. T7. and λ phage have also been used.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1094558
‘ome on the range,Hit,Home on the Range,United States state songs#History of the American West#American patriotic songs#Burl Ives songs#Kansas culture#American folk songs,Film#Western music,"Home on the Range" is the state song of the American state of Kansas. Dr. Brewster M. Higley (1823–1911) originally wrote the words in a poem called "My Western Home" in the early 1870s in Smith County. Kansas. The poem was first published in a December 1873 issue of the Smith County Pioneer under the title "Oh. Give Me a Home Where the Buffalo Roam". The music was written by a friend of Higley's named Daniel E. Kelley. Higley's original words are similar to those of the song today but not identical. The song was adopted by settlers. cowboys. and others and spread across the USA in various forms. During the early 20th century. it was arranged by Texas composer David W. Guion (1892–1981) who is often credited as the composer. It was officially adopted as the state song of Kansas on June 30. 1947. and is commonly regarded as the unofficial anthem of the American West.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2477713

Delivering on the promise of bone morphogenetic proteins,Hit,Bone morphogenetic protein,Proteins#Developmental biology#Bone morphogenetic protein#Growth factors,,Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a group of growth factors also known as cytokines and as metabologens. Originally discovered by their ability to induce the formation of bone and cartilage. BMPs are now considered to constitute a group of pivotal morphogenetic signals. orchestrating tissue architecture throughout the body. The important functioning of BMP signals in physiology is emphasized by the multitude of roles for dysregulated BMP signalling in pathological processes. Especially cancerous disease often involves misregulation of the BMP signalling system. Absence of BMP signalling is. for instance. an important factor in the progression of colon cancer and conversely overactivation of BMP signalling following reflux-induced esophagitis provokes Barrett's esophagus and is thus instrumental in the development of adenocarcinoma in the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal tract.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6111353

It derives its name from the idea that DNA can be used to supplement or alter genes within an individual's cells as a therapy to treat disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional. therapeutic gene in order to replace a mutated gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a mutation. or using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a natural human gene) to provide treatment. In gene therapy. DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a "vector". which is used to get the DNA inside cells within the body. Once inside. the DNA becomes expressed by the cell machinery. resulting in the production of therapeutic protein. which in turn treats the patient's disease.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1045408

RNase P: from biological function to biotechnological applications,Hit,RNase P,Ribozymes#RNA splicing#Ribonucleases,Organisms#Science,Ribonuclease P (RNase P)  is a type of ribonuclease which cleaves RNA. RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme – a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would. Its function is to cleave off an extra. or precursor. sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules. Further RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome). the discovery of which earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989: in the 1970s. Altman discovered the existence of precursor tRNA with flanking sequences and was the first to characterize RNase P and its activity in processing of the 5' leader sequence of precursor tRNA. Recent findings also reveal that RNase P has a new function. It has been shown that human nuclear RNase P is required for the normal and efficient transcription of various small noncoding RNA genes. such as tRNA. 5S rRNA. SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes. which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. one of three major nuclear RNA polymerases in human cells.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1175287

Structural proteomics: developments in structure-to-function predictions,Hit,Structural genomics,Structural biology#Natural sciences#Biology#Genome projects#Genomics,Genetics#Science,Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome. rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available. structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously-solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1030690

Unlike genomics. functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription. translation. and protein–protein interactions. as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes. RNA transcripts. and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions. generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1092292

Mastering the complexity of DNA nanostructures,Hit,DNA nanotechnology,DNA#DNA nanotechnology,,DNA nanotechnology is the design and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field. nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. This use is enabled by the strict base pairing rules of nucleic acids. which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong. rigid double helix structures. This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with precisely controlled nanoscale features. DNA is the dominant material used. but structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have also been constructed. leading to the occasional use of the name nucleic acid nanotechnology to describe the field.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2237742

Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10 −12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence. known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-. silver-. or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1183938

"poison" in classic Greek; "drug" in modern Greek; and . -logia "study of". "knowledge of") is the branch of medicine and biology concerned with the study of drug action . where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made. natural. or endogenous (within the cell) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell. tissue. organ. or organism. More specifically. it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties. they are considered pharmaceuticals. The field encompasses drug composition and properties. interactions. toxicology. therapy. and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The former studies the effects of the drugs on biological systems. and the latter the effects of biological systems on the drugs. In broad terms. pharmacodynamics discusses the interactions of chemicals with biological receptors. and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption. distribution. metabolism. and excretion of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology. a biomedical science. deals with how drugs interact within biological systems to affect function. It is the study of drugs. of the reactions of the body and drug on each other. the sources of drugs. their nature. and their properties.

The development of electrospray ionization for the analysis of biological macromolecules was rewarded with the attribution of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to John Bennett Fenn in 2002.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/5713645
Training neural networks to analyse biological sequences,Hit,Biomolecular structure,Biomolecules,,Biomolecular structure is the structure of biomolecules. mainly proteins and the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. The structure of these molecules is frequently decomposed into primary structure. secondary structure. tertiary structure. and quaternary structure. The scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary structural elements which are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable "domains" of protein structure and nucleic acid structure. including secondary structure like hairpin loops. bulges and internal loops for nucleic acids. and alpha helices and beta sheets for proteins.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6021329

It derives its name from the idea that DNA can be used to supplement or alter genes within an individual's cells as a therapy to treat disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional. therapeutic gene in order to replace a mutated gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a mutation. or using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a natural human gene) to provide treatment. In gene therapy. DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a "vector". which is used to get the DNA inside cells within the body. Once inside. the DNA becomes expressed by the cell machinery. resulting in the production of therapeutic protein. which in turn treats the patient's disease.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1045408

A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton's publications. Introduction to the History of Science (1927) and the Isis journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period. and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard. the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1056033

Enzymes as targets for drug design,Hit,Drug design,Design of experiments#Clinical research#Pharmacology#Medicinal chemistry#Drug discovery,,Drug design. sometimes referred to as rational drug design or more simply rational design. is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein. which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense. drug design involves the design of small molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is often referred to as computer-aided drug design.

CD4-targeted immune intervention: a strategy for the therapy of AIDS and autoimmune disease,Hit,Autoimmune disease,Autoimmune diseases,,Autoimmune diseases arise from an inappropriate immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In other words. the immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its own cells. This may be restricted to certain organs (e.g. in autoimmune thyroiditis) or involve a particular tissue in different places (e.g. Goodpasture's disease which may affect the basement membrane in both the lung and the kidney). The treatment of autoimmune diseases is typically with immunosuppression medication which decreases the immune response.

Protein fusions: bioseparation and application,Hit,Fusion protein,Biochemistry#Botany#Molecular biology#Natural sciences#Biology#Engineered proteins#Biomedical engineering#Organic compounds,Science,Fusion proteins or chimeric proteins are proteins created through the joining of two or more genes which originally coded for separate proteins. Translation of this fusion gene results in a single polypeptide with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins. Recombinant fusion proteins are created artificially by recombinant DNA technology for use in biological research or therapeutics. Chimeric mutant proteins occur naturally when a complex mutation. such as a chromosomal translocation. tandem duplication. or retrotransposition creates a novel coding sequence containing parts of the coding sequences from two different genes. Naturally occurring fusion proteins are commonly found in cancer cells. where they may function as oncoproteins. The bcr-abl fusion protein is a well-known example of an oncogenic fusion protein. and is considered to be the primary oncogenic driver of chronic myelogenous leukemia.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1100968

Biotechnology and sustainable development in the Third World,Hit,Third World,Country classifications#Development economics#Political terms,Countries#Economies,The term Third World arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either capitalism and NATO (which along with its allies represented the First World). or communism and the Soviet Union (which along with its allies represented the Second World). This definition provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the earth into three groups based on social. political. and economic divisions. Due to many of the Third World countries being extremely poor. it became a stereotype such that people commonly refer to undeveloped countries as "third world countries." often used in a pejorative way. Over the last few decades. the term 'Third World' has been used interchangeably with the Global South and Developing Countries to describe poorer countries that have struggled to attain steady economic development.

Protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function. structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The starting material is usually a biological tissue or a microbial culture. The various steps in the purification process may free the protein from a matrix that confines it. separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture. and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps may exploit differences in (for example) protein size. physico-chemical properties. binding affinity and biological activity.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/3366968

PCR amplification techniques for chromosome walking,Hit,Primer walking,Molecular biology#DNA,,Primer walking is a sequencing method of choice for sequencing DNA fragments between 1.3 and 7 kilobases. Such fragments are too long to be sequenced in a single sequence read using the chain termination method. This method works by dividing the long sequence into several consecutive short ones. The DNA of interest may be a plasmid insert. a PCR product or a fragment representing a gap when sequencing a genome. The term "primer walking" is used where the main aim is to sequence the genome. The term "chromosome walking" is used instead when we know the sequence but don't have a clone of a gene. For example the gene for a disease may be located near a specific marker such as an RFLP on the sequence.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2468957

On Role of the Competitive Sports in Building a Harmonious Society,Hit,Competition,Competition#Political economy#Psychology#Molecular biology#Biology#Ecology#Marketing#Social events#Economics terminology,Economies#Society#Drugs#Terminology#Competitions,Competition in biology. ecology. and sociology. is a contest between organisms. animals. individuals. groups. etc.. for territory. a niche. or a location of resources. for resources and goods. for prestige. recognition. awards. mates. or group or social status. for leadership; it is the opposite of cooperation. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared or which is desired individually but not in sharing and cooperation. Competition occurs naturally between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. For example. animals compete over water supplies. food. mates. and other biological resources. Humans compete usually for food and mates. though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth. prestige. and fame. Competition is also a major tenet in market economy and business is often associated with competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. and also competition inside a company is usually stimulated for meeting and reaching higher quality of services or products that the company produce or develop.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1010053

It is used as a weather forecasting tool. and could also be harnessed in monitoring climate change. The technique involves a low-Earth orbit satellite receiving a signal from a GPS satellite. The signal has to pass through the atmosphere and gets refracted along the way. The magnitude of the refraction depends on the temperature and water vapor concentration in the atmosphere.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/4366223

Research on Train Operation System in moving automatic block,Hit,Automatic Block Signaling,Railway signalling,,Automatic Block Signaling. or ABS. is a block system that consists of a series of signals that divide a railway line into a series of blocks and then functions to control the movement of trains between them through automatic signals. ABS operation is designed to allow trains operating in the same direction to follow each other in a safe manner without risk of rear end collision while reducing costs and increasing capacity from previous manual block systems that required human operators. The automatic operation comes from an ability to detect if blocks are occupied or otherwise obstructed and then convey that information to approaching trains. The term "Automatic" in ABS refers to the operation of the system without any outside intervention and contrasts with more modern traffic control systems that require external control to establish a flow of traffic.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/5834609

"text of written language") is a traditional style of written Chinese based on the grammar and vocabulary of ancient Chinese. making it different from any modern spoken form of Chinese. Classical Chinese was used for almost all formal correspondence in China until the early 20th century. and also. during various periods. in Japan. Korea and Vietnam. Among Chinese speakers. Classical Chinese has been largely replaced by written vernacular Chinese ( ; pinyin: báihuà. "plain speech"). a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken Mandarin Chinese. while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Classical Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1077868

In the simplest type of an automatic control loop. a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value. and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process. in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century. and advanced rapidly in the 20th.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1064030
Design of industrial mini-type measuring and recording device,Hit,Sound recording and reproduction,Media technology#Audio engineering#Sound production technology#Sound recording,,Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves. such as spoken voice. singing. instrumental music. or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure (acoustic sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record). In magnetic tape recording. the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current. which is then converted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet. which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process. with a bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electronically generated sound waves may also be recorded directly from devices such as an electric guitar pickup or a synthesizer. without the use of acoustics in the recording process other than the need for musicians to hear how well they are playing during recording sessions.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1007257

Dynamic Simulation and Analysis of the Machine-hydraulic coupling of the Fixed Garbage Compression Mechanism,Hit,Dynamic simulation,Process management#Operations research#Production and manufacturing#Ordinary differential equations#Computer physics engines#Embedded systems#Electro mechanical engineering#Partial differential equations#Gears#Control theory#Simulation software,,Dynamic simulation is the use of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. As mathematical models incorporate real-world constraints. like gear backlash (engineering) and rebound from a hard stop. equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A numerical simulation is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval. and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power. steam turbines. 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling. electric motors. econometric models. biological systems. robot arms. mass spring dampers. hydraulic systems. and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in process control and mechatronic systems for tuning the automatic control systems before they are connect to the real system. or for human training before they control the real system.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/2459775

In geometric terms. this means that every two different rows in a Hadamard matrix represent two perpendicular vectors. while in combinatorial terms. it means that every two different rows have matching entries in exactly half of their columns and mismatched entries in the remaining columns. It is a consequence of this definition that the corresponding properties hold for columns as well as rows. The n-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the rows of an n×n Hadamard matrix has the maximum possible n-dimensional volume among parallelotopes spanned by vectors whose entries are bounded in absolute value by 1. Equivalently. a Hadamard matrix has maximal determinant among matrices with entries of absolute value less than or equal to 1 and so. is an extremal solution of Hadamard's maximal determinant problem.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1881705

An Hadamard Matrix of Order 36.,Hit,Hadamard matrix,Unsolved problems in mathematics#Matrices#Design theory,,In mathematics. an Hadamard matrix. named after the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard. is a square matrix whose entries are either +1 or 1 and whose rows are mutually orthogonal. In geometric terms. this means that every two different rows in a Hadamard matrix represent two perpendicular vectors. while in combinatorial terms. it means that every two different rows have matching entries in exactly half of their columns and mismatched entries in the remaining columns. It is a consequence of this definition that the corresponding properties hold for columns as well as rows. The n-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the rows of an n×n Hadamard matrix has the maximum possible n-dimensional volume among parallelotopes spanned by vectors whose entries are bounded in absolute value by 1. Equivalently. a Hadamard matrix has maximal determinant among matrices with entries of absolute value less than or equal to 1 and so. is an extremal solution of Hadamard's maximal determinant problem.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1881705

Proof of a positivity conjecture on Schur functions.,Hit,Schur polynomial,Invariant theory#Representation theory of finite groups#Symmetric functions#Homogeneous polynomials#Orthogonal polynomials,,In mathematics. Schur polynomials. named after Issai Schur. are certain symmetric polynomials in n variables. indexed by partitions. that generalize the elementary symmetric polynomials and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. In representation theory they are the characters of irreducible representations of the general linear groups. The Schur polynomials form a linear basis for the space of all symmetric polynomials. Any product of Schur functions can be written as a linear combination of Schur polynomials with non-negative integral coefficients; the values of these coefficients is given combinatorially by the Littlewood-Richardson rule. More generally. skew Schur polynomials are associated with pairs of partitions and have similar properties to Schur polynomials.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/4511034

These coefficients are natural numbers. which the Littlewood–Richardson rule describes as counting certain skew tableaux. They occur in many other mathematical contexts. for instance as multiplicity in the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of general linear groups (or related groups like the special linear and special unitary groups). or in the decomposition of certain induced representations in the representation theory of the symmetric group. or in the area of algebraic combinatorics dealing with Young tableaux and symmetric polynomials,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/6531611

Most commonly the viscosity (resistance to deformation or other forces) of non-Newtonian fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history. However. there are some non-Newtonian fluids with shear-independent viscosity. that nonetheless exhibit normal stress-differences or other non-Newtonian behaviour. Many salt solutions and molten polymers are non-Newtonian fluids. as are many commonly found substances such as ketchup. custard. toothpaste. starch suspensions. paint. blood. and shampoo. In a Newtonian fluid. the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is linear. passing through the origin. the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid. the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is different. and can even be time-dependent.

Complexity theory of real functions,Hit,Computational complexity theory,Models of computation#Computational complexity theory#Theoretical computer science,,Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science and mathematics that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty. and relating those classes to each other. In this context. a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer (which basically means that the problem can be stated by a set of mathematical instructions). Informally. a computational problem consists of problem instances and solutions to these problem instances. For example. primality testing is the problem of determining whether a given number is prime or not. The instances of this problem are natural numbers. and the solution to an instance is yes or no based on whether the number is prime or not.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1056887

The User Network Interface (UNI). v. 3.1. ISBN 0-13-393828-X. Prentice Hall PTR. 1995. page 2. and is designed to unify telecommunication and computer networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing. and it encodes data into small. fixed-sized cells. This differs from approaches such as the Internet Protocol or Ethernet that use variable sized packets or frames. ATM provides data link layer services that run over a wide range of OSI physical Layer links. ATM has functional similarity with both circuit switched networking and small packet switched networking. It was designed for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic (e.g.. file transfers). and real-time. low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins. ATM is a core protocol used over the SONET/SDH backbone of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). but its use is declining in favour of All IP.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1081376
Machine learning: an integrated framework and its applications,Hit,Machine learning,Machine learning#Cybernetics#Applied sciences#Artificial intelligence#Learning#Learning in computer vision,Science,Machine learning. a branch of artificial intelligence. is a scientific discipline concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data. such as from sensor data or databases. A learner can take advantage of examples (data) to capture characteristics of interest of their unknown underlying probability distribution. Data can be seen as examples that illustrate relations between observed variables. A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data; the difficulty lies in the fact that the set of all possible behaviors given all possible inputs is too large to be covered by the set of observed examples (training data). Hence the learner must generalize from the given examples. so as to be able to produce a useful output in new cases.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1074721

In other words. it is possible. for example. that variations in three or four observed variables mainly reflect the variations in fewer such unobserved variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modeled as linear combinations of the potential factors. plus "error" terms. The information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Computationally this technique is equivalent to low rank approximation of the matrix of observed variables. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics. and is used in behavioral sciences. social sciences. marketing. product management. operations research. and other applied sciences that deal with large quantities of data.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/5904530

The Yang-Baxter equation and a systematic search for Poisson brackets on associative algebras,Hit,Poisson bracket,Binary operations#Bilinear operators#Theoretical physics#Symplectic geometry#Natural sciences#Physics#Mathematical terminology#Hamiltonian mechanics,Algebra#Science#Terminology,In mathematics and classical mechanics. the Poisson bracket is an important binary operation in Hamiltonian mechanics. playing a central role in Hamilton's equations of motion. which govern the time-evolution of a Hamiltonian dynamical system. The Poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate-transformations. the so-called "canonical transformations". which maps canonical coordinate systems into canonical coordinate systems. (A "canonical coordinate system" consists of canonical position/momentum variables. that satisfy canonical Poisson-bracket relations.) Note that the set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. For instance. often it is possible to choose the Hamiltonian itself H = H(q.p;t) as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1028291

Nyquist criterion. state-feedback. pole placement); however. one or both of the controller and the system under control in a general control system may not be an LTI system. and so these methods cannot necessarily be applied directly. Nonlinear control theory studies how to apply existing linear methods to these more general control systems. Additionally. it provides novel control methods that cannot be analyzed using LTI system theory. Even when LTI system theory can be used for the analysis and design of a controller. a nonlinear controller can have attractive characteristics (e.g.. simpler implementation. increased speed. or decreased control energy); however. nonlinear control theory usually requires more rigorous mathematical analysis to justify its conclusions.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/5253862

Elementary examples of such relations include the dot product. the cross product. and linear maps. Vectors and scalars themselves are also tensors. A tensor can be represented as a multi-dimensional array of numerical values. The order (also degree or rank) of a tensor is the dimensionality of the array needed to represent it. or equivalently. the number of indices needed to label a component of that array. For example. a linear map can be represented by a matrix. a 2-dimensional array. and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor. A vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array and is a 1st-order tensor. Scalars are single numbers and are thus zeroth-order tensors.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1007087

Some properties of many valued fuzzy sets,Hit,Fuzzy set,Fuzzy logic#Natural sciences#Mechanical engineering#Systems of set theory#Mathematical terminology,Science#Terminology,Fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced simultaneously by Lotfi A. Zadeh and Dieter Klaua in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set. In classical set theory. the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast. fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval 0. 1. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets. since the indicator functions of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets. if the latter only take values 0 or 1.

Spreading activation over distributed microfeatures,Hit,Spreading activation,Search algorithms#Memory#Semantics#Psycholinguistics#Artificial intelligence#Algorithms,,Spreading activation is a method for searching associative networks. neural networks. or semantic networks. The search process is initiated by labeling a set of source nodes (e.g. concepts in a semantic network) with weights or "activation" and then iteratively propagating or "spreading" that activation out to other nodes linked to the source nodes. Most often these "weights" are real values that decay as activation propagates through the network. When the weights are discrete this process is often referred to as marker passing. Activation may originate from alternate paths. identified by distinct markers. and terminate when two alternate paths reach the same node.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/4395838

A preliminary evaluation of a massively parallel processor: GAPP,Hit,Parallel computing,Applied sciences#Computing terminology#Distributed computing#Computer science#Theoretical computer science#Parallel computing,Science,Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously. operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones. which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level. instruction level. data. and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years. mainly in high-performance computing. but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years. parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture. mainly in the form of multicore processors.

In this view of logic programming. which can be traced at least as far back as Alonzo Church 1932. logical inference can be used in programming. This view was further developed by John McCarthy's 1958 advice-taker proposal to use forward chaining under the control of logical propositions. The Planner programming language 1969. 1971 used both forward chaining (invoked by assertions) and backward chaining (invoked by goals).,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1001393

An autonomous, decentralized control system for factory automation,Hit,Automation,Automation#Engineering disciplines#Industrial automation,,Automation is the use of machines. control systems and information technologies to optimize productivity in the production of goods and delivery of services. The correct incentive for applying automation is to increase productivity. and/or quality beyond that possible with current human labor levels so as to realize economies of scale. and/or realize predictable quality levels. The incorrect application of automation. which occurs most often. is an effort to eliminate or replace human labor. Simply put. whereas correct application of automation can net as much as 3 to 4 times original output with no increase in current human labor costs. Incorrect application of automation can only save a fraction of current labor level costs. In the scope of industrialisation. automation is a step beyond mechanisation. Whereas mechanisation provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work. Automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements while increasing load capacity. speed. and repeatability. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.,http://xlore.org/sigInfo.action?uri=http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/instance/1108341
